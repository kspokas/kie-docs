= Putting it all together

Let’s consider an example of how some of these components work together. A flight from San Diego to New York is cancelled, requiring the airline to find alternate arrangements for its inconvenienced passengers. First, the airline brings together the information necessary to determine how best to get the travelers to their destinations:

*Inputs*
* a list of flights
* a list of passengers

*Decisions*
* prioritizing the passengers who will get seats on a new flight
* determining which flights those passengers will be offered

*Business knowledge*
* The company process for determining passenger priority
* Any flights that have space available
* Company rules for determining how best to reassign inconvenienced customers

Then, the airline uses the DMN standard to model its decision process in a Decision Requirements Diagram (DRD), and arrives at the following diagram for determining the best rebooking solution:

You see that, similar to flowcharts, DRDs use shapes to represent the different elements in a process. Here, ovals represent the two necessary inputs, rectangles illustrate the decision points in the model, and rectangles with cut corners are references to the business knowledge models the airline will use to inform its decision process.

Further, DRD places details for each element into boxed content that provide variable definitions, again using FEEL expressions. Some content can be quite simple, such as the airline’s decision process for establishing a prioritized waiting list

Other elements can involve significantly greater detail and calculation. Consider the airline's business knowledge model for "Reassign Next Passenger":

The Passenger Rebooking example is a real-world case with layers of complex detail. The next sections will pare back the intricacy and examine simple cases much more closely than we have thus far.
