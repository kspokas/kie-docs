= Expressing rules in FEEL

Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) is a new expression language defined by the DMN specification. It aims to bridge the gap between decision modelling and execution by assigning semantics to the decision model constructs.

FEEL expressions in Decision Requirement Diagrams (DRD) occupy either table cells in Decision Tables, or decision points. They define variables and input/output values, and are expressed in one of two levels of compliance:

* *Simple FEEL (S-FEEL):* Defines the more basic models with logic modeled mostly or entirely in decision tables. Chapter 9 of the OMG specification document covers S-FEEL in greater detail.
* *Full expression language (FEEL):* Offers the full range of FEEL expressions defined in Chapter 10 of the OMG specification document.
