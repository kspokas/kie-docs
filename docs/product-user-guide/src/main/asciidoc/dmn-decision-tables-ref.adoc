= Decision Table Hit Policies

Hit policies define how to reach an outcome when multiple rules apply to a single situation. Decision modelers select one of five methods for reaching an outcome and then specify that method by placing an indicator in the tableâ€™s upper-left corner. The five policies are:

* *Unique (indicator: U):* Permits only one rule to match; any overlap represents an error.
* *Any (A):* Permits rules with identical output values to overlap. Other overlap would create inconsistencies in the table, creating an error.
* *Priority (P):* Permits overlapping rules with different output values only if the hit policy establishes a priority order in the table output column heading. Priority tables that omit valid outputs are in error.
* *First (F):* Uses the first acceptable rule, based on the listed order of rules.
* *Collect (C+, C>, C<, C#):* Aggregates output from multiple rules based on an aggregation code.
** *Collect ( C ):* Aggregates values in an arbitrary list.
** *Collect Sum (C+):* Outputs the sum of all collected values. Values must be numeric.
** *Collect Min (C<):* Outputs the smallest numeric value.
** *Collect Max (C>):* Outputs the largest numeric value.
** *Collect Count (C#):* Outputs the number of matching rules.
