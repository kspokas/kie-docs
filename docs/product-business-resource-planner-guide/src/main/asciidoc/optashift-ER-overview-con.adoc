= Overview of the employee rostering starter application

The employee rostering starter application assigns employees to shifts on various positions in an organization. For example, you can use the application to distribute shifts in a hospital between nurses, guard duty shifts across a number of locations, or shifts on an assembly line between workers.

Optimal employee rostering must take a number of variables into account. For example, different skills can be necessary for shifts in different positions. Also, some employees might be unavailable for some time slots or might prefer a particular time slot. You can specify inputs for these variables using the tabs along the top of the application window.

IMPORTANT: In the current release, the employee rostering starter application fills a fixed amount of shifts in predefined dates. You can not change the dates or shifts.
Therefore, it is not possible to use this application for production tasks. You can, however, update any skill, spot, or employee value after you have added them to the system.

== Entering source information for employee rostering
In order to produce an optimal employee roster, a set of input data is required: skills, spots and employees.  Additional data, such as employee availability and rotation orders, can be used to further optimize the generated roster output.

.Tenants

In the *TENANT* field at the top right corner of the application window, you can select one of the predefined tenants. Each tenant represents an independent set of data (inputs and roster outputs); any change in the data for one tenant does not affect any other tenants.

You can switch between tenants to use several independent data sets, for example, to prepare employee rosters for different locations.

.Skills
In the skills section, you can set all skills that can be necessary in any position within the roster. For example, a 24-hour diner would require cooking, serving, bussing, and hosting skills, in addition to skills such as general human resources and restaurant operations.

To enter these skills, click the *Skills* tab.

.Edit skills list:
* Add new skill:
  ** Click *Add Skill*
  ** Type the name of the new skill into the text box that appears.
  ** Click *Save Skill*.
* Edit skill names by clicking the *Edit Skill* icon (pencil shape).
* Delete skills by clicking the *Delete Skill* icon (trashcan shape).

NOTE: Skill names must be unique for each tenant.  Skills can not be deleted when they are associated with an employee or spot.

.Spots
Spots refer to the various positions at the business. For a diner, spots include the bar, the bussing stations, the front counter, the various kitchen stations, the serving areas, and the office. For each spot, you can select one or more required skills from the list that you entered in the Skills tab. The following figure shows a sample list of spots and skills for the factory tenant example:

.Edit spots list:
* Add new spot:
  ** Click *Add Spot*
  ** Type the name of the new spot into the text box that appears.
  ** Select one or more skills from the combo-drop down list that appears.
  ** Click *Save Spot*.
* Edit spot names and associated skills by clicking the *Edit Spot* icon (pencil shape).
* Delete spots by clicking the *Delete Spot* icon (trashcan shape).

NOTE: Spot names must be unique for each tenant.  Spots can not be deleted when they are associated with an employee roster.

.Employees
The Employees tab contains a list of all people employed by the business and the skills they possess. The following figure contains an excerpt of the employees in the factory tenant example:

.Edit employee list:
* Add new employee:
  ** Click *Add Employee*
  ** Type the name of the new employee into the text box that appears.
  ** Select one or more skills from the combo-drop down list that appears.
  ** Click *Save Employee*.
* Edit employee names and associated skills by clicking the *Edit Employee* icon (pencil shape).
* Delete employees by clicking the *Delete Employee* icon (trashcan shape).

NOTE: Employee names must be unique for each tenant.  Employees can not be deleted when they are associated with an employee roster.

.Spot Roster
The Spot Roster is a table of all shifts (time slots) during which the business is open and all spots that must be manned during each shift.  Each shift is represented by a rectangle at the intersection of a spot (row) and time span (column).

Spots can support multiple employees per shift. If a spot is not required for a shift, you can remove all of the shifts completely from the roster for that time span.

.Spot roster for factory tenant example

Double click an open area in the schedule to add a new shift to the schedule or double click an existing shift to edit it.  The value for the spot type and time frame are not editable, and are determined by where in the open schedule was clicked.  By default, the employee is not editable either as this will be determined by the planning engine.  A particular employee can be "pinned" to a shift by selecting the *Pinned* check box and selecting the employee from the *Employee* drop down.

.Rotation Patterns
The *Rotation* tab allows the schedule administrator to specify the preferred shift rotations within a given scheduling period.  This can be used to promote desired traits in the generated schedule such as fairness in the assignment of shifts among employees.

These assignment suggestions are "low priority" and will be superseded by "higher priority" constraints such as employee availability and pinned assignments in the spot roster.

[NOTE]
====
In the current version, the rotation data is essentially pre-set in the example data sets.  In a subsequent version, these rotation preferences will be fully editable from the user interface.

== Creating an optimal employee roster

.Procedure
. Adjust the skills, employee and spot types.
. Move to the *Spot Roster* tab:
.. Adjust the pre-populated shifts by adding/removing as necessary.
.. Pin specific employees to shifts as necessary.
.. Click the Solve button to create an optimized solution.

The engine takes up to 30 seconds to create a fully optimal result.

When the optimal result is available, the Spot Roster displays the name of the assigned employee for each spot and shift.

== Setting employee availability
[NOTE]
====
This section is not fully functional in the current release and will be enabled in a subsequent release.

.Employee Roster
The employee roster tab displays an employee-centric view of the schedule with a row for each employee depicting their assigned shifts.

The employee roster also allows the specification of availability preferences for particular employees:
* Double click on the schedule within the row of an employee to open the *Edit availability* pop-up.
* Select the availability preference (unavailable, undesired, desired).
* Click *Apply* to save.

.Employee availability preferences example

After making changes to employee availability, click the *Solve* button on the Spot Roster tab to update the schedule.

[NOTE]
====
The Unavailable option also applies for employees who call in sick or are on vacation. If an employee calls out just before a shift, a manager can indicate the scheduled employee’s unavailability and then create a new schedule.
====

== Constraints
The {PLANNER} rules for this starter application use  both hard and soft constraints. During an optimization, the engine may not violate hard constraints, for example, if an employee is unavailable (out sick), or that an employee cannot work two spots in a single shift. The engine tries to adhere to soft constraints, such as an employee’s preference to not work a specific shift, but can violate them if the optimal solution requires it.
